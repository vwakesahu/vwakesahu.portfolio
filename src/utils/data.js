  description: `So, here&rsquo;s the story of Jobshunt. I got this 
    <span class="text-secondary-foreground font-semibold">freelancing gig</span> 
    to create <span class="text-secondary-foreground font-semibold">a job portal for web3 folks.</span> 
    Everything was going great until, out of nowhere, the client disappeared. Yep, just vanished! 
    I was left holding the bag (or, in this case, the code). But instead of giving up, I decided to 
    turn this into a <span class="text-secondary-foreground font-semibold">personal project.</span> In my third 
    year of college, I rolled up my sleeves and built the whole thing by myself. 
    <span class="text-secondary-foreground font-semibold">I used ReactJS for the frontend, Firebase for the backend, and 
    EmailJS to handle email communications.</span> Jobshunt is designed to help people in the web3 community find jobs. 
    Whether you&rsquo;re into blockchain, crypto, or any other web3 tech, this portal is for you. Building it was a 
    fantastic learning experience, and <span class="text-secondary-foreground font-semibold">it taught me a lot about 
    persistence and problem-solving.</span> So, if you&rsquo;re checking out my portfolio, know that Jobshunt is a project born out of 
    a little chaos and a lot of determination. You can find the <a href='https://github.com/vwakesahu/jobshunt' target='_blank' class="font-semibold text-blue-500 cursor-pointer">source code</a> over here.`,
